A minecraft mod that helps aiming (at mods, blocks, but not players). Made for newbies or disabled players with difficulties to aim in general.

## Config

**Forge has still not implemented the HUD to customize mod's settings, so for now, you need to update the settings by hand.** 
You can change the settings of the mod in the .minecraft/config folder. Then, open aimassistancemod-client.toml and update the values.

## Disclamer

**The mod has been designed to simplify the gameplay of people with disabilities (or newbies)**.

If you play online, make sure that the server allows the use of this mod. It won't work on
other players anyway, so it won't give you a PvP advantage. Also, the server owner can easily
blacklist this mod by blacklisting its id ("aimassistancemod"). I am not responsible for any
misuse of this mod.
